# library-mangement-system

In a traditional library management system, everything is done manually. All the library operations and records, including the number of books, genres of books, names of books, records of the students whoâ€™ve issued/returned books, etc., are all done via pen and paper. Naturally, this process requires a significant amount of time, effort, and even human resources.
By using this software application, librarians and students need not search the entire library to find a book. 
They can enter the name and author of the book, and the system will display the list of all the possible books available for that search keyword/phrase
